JGPT is an interactive GUI application built using Python and Tkinter that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT model to provide natural language processing capabilities. With JGPT, users can easily ask questions or provide prompts via a simple graphical interface and receive responses generated by the GPT model.

Features:
User-Friendly Interface: JGPT offers a clean and intuitive user interface, making it accessible to users of all levels of technical proficiency.
Question-Answer Interaction: Users can input questions or prompts in a text field and receive generated responses in real-time.
Word Wrapping: Long responses are automatically wrapped to fit within the text box, ensuring readability.
Custom Icon: The application comes with a custom icon, adding a personal touch to the user experience.
How It Works:
Enter your question or prompt in the input field.
Click the "Generate Answer" button or press CTRL + ENTER to trigger the GPT model to generate a response.
The response will be displayed in the output text box, allowing you to read and interact with it.
Repeat the process to ask additional questions or provide new prompts.
Usage:
To use JGPT, simply run the Python script provided in this repository. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Tkinter and the OpenAI GPT command-line tool (tgpt). You may need to customize the script to point to the location of your tgpt executable.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
OpenAI GPT command-line tool (tgpt)
